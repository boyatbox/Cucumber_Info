Scenarios are like test cases and start with the Scenario keyword in a new line (different from the Feature intent). The text that immediately follows the Scenario keyword, and is on the same line, is the Scenario Title.


There can be only one Background in one Feature file and it allows us to set a precondition for all Scenarios in a Feature file.
A Background is like a Scenario, containing a number of Steps.
Background is run before each Scenario, but after the BeforeScenario Hooks.

A Feature/Scenario can have multiple Tags; just separate them with spaces or put them on a different line.Inheritance is when Tags are inherited. If a Feature file has a Tag, then Cucumber will assign that Tag to all Scenarios and all Scenario Outlines in that Feature file.
