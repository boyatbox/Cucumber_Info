Scenarios are like test cases and start with the Scenario keyword in a new line (different from the Feature intent). The text that immediately follows the Scenario keyword, and is on the same line, is the Scenario Title.


There can be only one Background in one Feature file and it allows us to set a precondition for all Scenarios in a Feature file.
A Background is like a Scenario, containing a number of Steps.
Background is run before each Scenario, but after the BeforeScenario Hooks.

A Feature/Scenario can have multiple Tags; just separate them with spaces or put them on a different line.Inheritance is when Tags are inherited. If a Feature file has a Tag, then Cucumber will assign that Tag to all Scenarios and all Scenario Outlines in that Feature file.

Pending Steps
When we use the code suggested by Cucumber in our Step Definition file, and we run the Feature file then we get Pending Steps Exception.
Pending Steps Exception is because of following Code:throw new PendingException();
When Cucumber encounters this statement, it understands that these Steps are still a work in progress Step.
Status of the Scenario is pending, First Step having PendingException() will be marked as pending and all other Steps in that Scenario are skipped.

Undefined Steps
When we first executed the Feature file, Cucumber did not find any matching Step Definitions, that's why Cucumber gave us Undefined Steps Error.
Cucumber will also give its own Suggestion for getting rid of Undefined Steps. All subsequent Steps after Undefined Step in the Scenario are skipped and Scenario is marked as Fail.
